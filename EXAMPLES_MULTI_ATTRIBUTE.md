# Enhanced Multi-Attribute Input Processing

The application now supports intelligent extraction of multiple attributes from a single user input, eliminating the need for multiple prompts.

## Examples

### 1. Module and Service Configuration
**Input:** `"create a module called tradelicence and service as NewTl"`

**Extracted Attributes:**
- `module: "tradelicence"`
- `service: "NewTl"`

**Result:** Both module and service configurations are automatically generated and applied.

### 2. Workflow Configuration
**Input:** `"create workflow with states DRAFT, PENDING, APPROVED"`

**Extracted Attributes:**
- `states: ["DRAFT", "PENDING", "APPROVED"]`

**Result:** Complete workflow configuration with the specified states.

### 3. Form Fields Configuration
**Input:** `"form fields: name (text, required), email (email, required), age (number)"`

**Extracted Attributes:**
- `fields: [{ name: "name", type: "text", required: true }, { name: "email", type: "email", required: true }, { name: "age", type: "number" }]`

**Result:** Complete form fields configuration with validation rules.

### 4. Billing Configuration
**Input:** `"billing with tax head TL_FEE amount 1000"`

**Extracted Attributes:**
- `taxHead: [{ code: "TL_FEE", amount: 1000 }]`

**Result:** Billing configuration with tax head details.

### 5. Access Control Configuration
**Input:** `"access control with roles CITIZEN, EMPLOYEE"`

**Extracted Attributes:**
- `roles: ["CITIZEN", "EMPLOYEE"]`

**Result:** Access control configuration with user roles.

## How It Works

1. **Input Sanitization:** The AI analyzes the user input to extract all relevant attributes
2. **Schema Mapping:** Extracted attributes are mapped to appropriate schema properties
3. **Validation:** Each extracted attribute is validated against the schema
4. **Multi-Section Generation:** Multiple sections can be configured simultaneously
5. **Context Preservation:** Previous configurations are maintained and enhanced

## Benefits

- **Reduced Prompts:** No need to ask for each attribute separately
- **Intelligent Parsing:** Understands natural language variations
- **Schema Compliance:** All generated configurations follow schema rules
- **Context Awareness:** Builds upon existing configurations
- **Error Handling:** Graceful fallback for unclear inputs

## Supported Patterns

- `"create a module called [name] and service as [name]"`
- `"module [name] service [name]"`
- `"workflow with states [state1], [state2], [state3]"`
- `"form fields: [field1] ([type]), [field2] ([type])"`
- `"billing with tax head [code] amount [amount]"`
- `"access control with roles [role1], [role2]"`

The system is designed to be flexible and can handle various natural language patterns while ensuring all generated configurations are valid and complete.
