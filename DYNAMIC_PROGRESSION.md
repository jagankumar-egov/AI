# Dynamic Progression and Default Configuration

The application now features intelligent dynamic progression that adapts based on user completion patterns and provides quick options for faster configuration.

## Dynamic Progression Behavior

### After 2+ Steps Completed

Once you've completed 2 or more sections, the interface changes to a more focused mode:

**Enhanced Next Step Display:**
```
âœ… 3 sections completed! 

Now let's configure the **Workflow** section:

Configure workflow states and transitions for your service.

**ðŸ’¡ Quick Options:**
â€¢ Describe your specific requirements
â€¢ Say "keep it default" to use default settings and skip to next
â€¢ Say "skip this section" to move to the next section

**ðŸŽ¯ Example:** Try describing what you need for workflow

What would you like to configure for Workflow?
```

### First Few Steps

For the first 1-2 steps, full guidance is provided:

```
Great! Now let's configure the **Module** section:

Basic module information and configuration.

**ðŸ“‹ Copy & Edit These Prompts:**

1. **Basic Module**
   `Create a module called [module_name]`
   Basic module configuration

**ðŸ’¡ How to use:**
1. Copy any prompt above
2. Edit it with your specific requirements
3. Paste it in the chat below
4. I'll generate the configuration for you

**ðŸŽ¯ Example:** Try describing what you need for module

What would you like to configure for Module?
```

## Quick Commands

### "Keep it Default"

When you say "keep it default", the system:
1. Generates sensible default configuration for the current section
2. Applies it automatically
3. Moves to the next section immediately
4. Shows a success message: `âœ… Applied default configuration for workflow. Moving to the next step...`

**Example:**
```
User: "keep it default"
System: âœ… Applied default configuration for workflow. Moving to the next step...
```

### "Skip this Section"

When you say "skip this section", the system:
1. Skips the current section entirely
2. Moves to the next section immediately
3. Shows a confirmation message: `âœ… Skipped the current section. Moving to the next step...`

**Example:**
```
User: "skip this section"
System: âœ… Skipped the current section. Moving to the next step...
```

## Supported Commands

### Default Configuration Commands:
- `"keep it default"`
- `"use default"`
- `"default settings"`
- `"apply default"`
- `"use default configuration"`

### Skip Section Commands:
- `"skip this section"`
- `"skip section"`
- `"move to next"`
- `"skip to next"`
- `"next section"`

## Progress Indicators

The progress panel shows when quick mode is enabled:

```
Configuration Progress
âœ… Quick mode enabled - After 2+ steps, you can use "keep it default" or "skip this section"
```

## Benefits

1. **Faster Configuration**: Quick commands reduce time spent on each section
2. **Adaptive Interface**: More guidance for beginners, quick options for experienced users
3. **Flexible Progression**: Users can choose to customize or use defaults
4. **Smart Defaults**: Default configurations are production-ready and follow best practices
5. **Progress Awareness**: Clear indication of completion status and available options

## Default Configuration Quality

When using "keep it default", the system generates:
- âœ… Schema-compliant configurations
- âœ… Production-ready default values
- âœ… Industry-standard patterns
- âœ… All required fields included
- âœ… Sensible defaults based on section type

## Example Workflow

1. **Start**: Configure first 2 sections with full guidance
2. **Quick Mode**: After 2+ completions, interface shows focused options
3. **Customize**: Describe specific requirements for important sections
4. **Default**: Use "keep it default" for standard sections
5. **Skip**: Use "skip this section" for optional sections
6. **Complete**: All sections configured efficiently

This dynamic approach makes the configuration process much more efficient while maintaining flexibility for users who need custom configurations.
